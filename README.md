# Chernoff
C++ program for computing Chernoff's distribution
The program was written using Xcode. A makefile for compiling the program on other platforms is in the subdirectory Chernoff.
It corresponds to the paper "Computing Chernoff's Distribution" by Jon
Wellner and myself in the Journal of Computational and Graphical
Statistics, volume 10, 2001, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/10618600152627997
A pdf file of the corresponding report is Chernoff.pdf.

The program produces the first 10 moments and some higher quantiles, but can be modified to provide more informaton, for example more quantiles.
